The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

- Store the following into variables:
  number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

- Output your fortune to the screen like so:
  "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var job ="IT";
console.log ("You will be a "+ job + " in "+ local + ", and married to "
+ spouse + " with "+ numkids + " kids.");
